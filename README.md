# Project Title: Text Summarization Application in C++

Project Description:

Overview:
The "Text Summarization Application in C++" is a software tool designed to help users extract main points and keywords from a given text document or input text. This project offers a simplified, non-AI-based approach to text summarization, making it ideal for scenarios where advanced machine learning models are not required.

Key Features:

Keyword Extraction: The application extracts keywords and main points from a provided text, allowing users to quickly identify the most important elements within the content.

Customizable Output: Users can specify the number of keywords or main points they wish to extract, giving them control over the level of summarization.

Case Insensitivity: The application is designed to be case-insensitive, ensuring that the frequency counts of words are not influenced by letter case.

Simple User Interface: The project includes a command-line interface that is easy to use and suitable for developers and non-technical users alike.

Efficient Algorithm: The summarization algorithm efficiently processes text, making it suitable for both small and large documents.

Use Cases:

Academic Research: Students and researchers can use the application to quickly identify the main points within lengthy research papers, articles, or documents.

Content Creation: Content creators and writers can utilize the tool to extract key concepts and terms from source materials, aiding in the generation of summaries or outlines.

Text Analysis: Businesses and organizations can apply the application for text analysis tasks, such as identifying important terms in customer reviews, feedback, or survey responses.

Information Retrieval: The application can be integrated into search engines or information retrieval systems to enhance content retrieval by using extracted keywords.

Technology Stack:

C++: The primary programming language for building the application.
Dependencies:

Standard C++ Libraries: Utilized for core functionality, including text processing and data structures.
Getting Started:

Users can run the C++ application on their local machines by compiling the source code. The tool accepts input text via standard input and provides extracted keywords or main points as output. Detailed instructions for usage are provided in the documentation.

Future Enhancements:

In the future, potential enhancements may include user-friendly graphical interfaces, more advanced summarization techniques, and support for additional languages and encodings.

Project Status:

The "Text Summarization Application in C++" is currently in development and is open-source, encouraging contributions from the developer community.
